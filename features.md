- Courses
Creating functionality to handle a Genki workbook/coursebook. Features??
How about we start creating the JSON for... anything! from there lets start creating simple features.
I would love for this progress to apply things other than Genki but we can worry about that later.

- reverse tests
screw courses, lets implement reversing the tests! 2020/03/16
Sooo, if you add the 'r' flag, it will reverse question and answer
* is this done?

- Add All
if I dont have an add all feature yet, create it

- Selective Selecting
At the moment im moving files back and forth between folders because I dont want to
see them all when loading. Also, loading is not very "massive quantities of tests"
friendly. Figure it out.
