We will not support html properly obviously
Will not support images,videos or sound, just text
create a settings file
	option to exclude tests suites with html,vid,audio,images
Not sure how nesting will work at the moment

real multi choice support:
- generate multiple choice from answers and questions without pre setting up something
- allow support for reversing the questions and answers as options

This will be a huge win. lets mock some shit up


{
  data: [
    { question: '1 + 1', answer: '2' },
    { question: '2 - 1', answer: '1' },
    { question: '-1 + 4', answer: '3'},
    { question: '4 + 0', answer: '4' }
  ]
}

how would the above be converted into a multi choice test suite??
Answer: we dont have to, we just need to randomly pluck 3 extra results from the pile
